Player
======

Player is the source code for the final app store version of the Pinna music player. It has had its sharing infrastructure removed, as this has backend dependencies that will no longer be available in 2014. Exfm integration has been left in the project. It is mostly in tact to leave a quick integration point for a future replacement service should there be interest.

Dependencies
============

Player's only external dependency is [RoundaboutKit](https://github.com/decarbonization/RoundaboutKit). The appropriate version is embedded in the project.
